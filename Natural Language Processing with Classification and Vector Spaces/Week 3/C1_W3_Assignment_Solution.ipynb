    "In natural language processing, we represent each word as a vector consisting of numbers.\n",
    "The vector encodes the meaning of the word. These numbers (or weights) for each word are learned using various machine\n",
    "learning models, which we will explore in more detail later in this specialization. Rather than make you code the\n",
    "machine learning models from scratch, we will show you how to use them. In the real world, you can always load the\n",

    "\n",
    "- Predict analogies between words.\n",
    "- Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the word embeddings and plot them in two dimensions.\n",

    "You are playing trivia against some second grader who just took their geography test and knows all the capitals by heart.\n",
    "Thanks to NLP, you will be able to answer the questions properly. In other words, you will write a program that can give\n",
    "you the country by its capital. That way you are pretty sure you will win the trivia game. We will start by exploring the data set.\n",
