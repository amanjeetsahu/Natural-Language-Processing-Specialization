    "Welcome to the fourth (and last) programming assignment of Course 2! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will practice how to compute word embeddings and use them for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "- To implement sentiment analysis, you can go beyond counting the number of positive words and negative words. \n",
    "- You can find a way to represent each word numerically, by a vector. \n",
    "- The vector could then represent syntactic (i.e. parts of speech) and semantic (i.e. meaning) structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will explore a classic way of generating word embeddings or representations.\n",
    "- You will implement a famous model called the continuous bag of words (CBOW) model. \n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this assignment you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train word vectors from scratch.\n",
    "- Learn how to create batches of data.\n",
    "- Understand how backpropagation works.\n",
    "- Plot and visualize your learned word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how to train these models will give you a better understanding of word vectors, which are building blocks to many applications in natural language processing."
