    "Using a statistical method like the one you implemented in course 2 will not give you results that are as good. Your model will not be able to encode information seen previously in the data set and as a result, the perplexity will increase. Remember from course 2 that the higher the perplexity, the worse your model is. Furthermore, statistical ngram models take up too much space and memory. As a result, it will be inefficient and too slow. Conversely, with deepnets, you can get a better perplexity. Note, learning about n-gram language models is still important and allows you to better understand deepnets.\n"
