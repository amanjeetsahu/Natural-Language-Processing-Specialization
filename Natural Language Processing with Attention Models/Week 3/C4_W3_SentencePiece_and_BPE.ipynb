It takes in the current `vocab` word-frequency dictionary and the fraction of the total `vocab_size` to merge characters in the words of the dictionary, `num_merges` times. Then for each *merge* operation it `get_stats` on how many of each pair of character sequences there are. It gets the most frequent *pair* of symbols as the `best` pair. Then it merges those pair of symbols (removes the space between them) in each word in the `vocab` that contains this `best` (= `pair`). Consquently, `merge_vocab` creates a new `vocab`, `v_out`. This process is repeated `num_merges` times and the result is the set of SentencePieces (keys of the final `sp_vocab`).\n",

[Warning](https://regex101.com/): the expression `(?<!\\S)` means that either whitespace character follows before the `bigram` or there is nothing before (beginning of word) the bigram, similarly for `(?!\\S)` for preceding whitespace or end of word.

There is also another technical difference in that in the SentencePiece implementation of BPE a priority queue is used to more efficiently keep track of the *best pairs*. Actually, there is a priority queue in the Python standard library called `heapq` if you would like to give that a try below! "
