The lowering of the diphthongs has long been current in many Dutch dialects , and is comparable to the English Great Vowel Shift , and the diphthongisation of long high vowels in Modern High German , which centuries earlier reached the state now found in Polder Dutch . Stroop theorizes that the lowering of open - mid to open diphthongs is a phonetically \" natural \" and inevitable development and that Dutch , after having diphthongised the long high vowels like German and English , \" should \" have lowered the diphthongs like German and English as well .

Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds.
