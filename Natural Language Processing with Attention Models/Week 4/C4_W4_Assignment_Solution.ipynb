    "Welcome to the last assignment of Course 4. Before you get started, we want to congratulate you on getting here. It is your 16th programming assignment in this Specialization and we are very proud of you! In this assignment, you are going to use the [Reformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451), also known as the efficient Transformer, to generate a dialogue between two bots. You will feed conversations to your model and it will learn how to understand the context of each one. Not only will it learn how to answer questions but it will also know how to ask questions if it needs more info. For example, after a customer asks for a train ticket, the chatbot can ask what time the said customer wants to leave. You can use this concept to automate call centers, hotel receptions, personal trainers, or any type of customer service. By completing this assignment, you will:\n",

Your function should return the conversation, prepending each field with either ' Person 1: ' if 'x' is even or ' Person 2: ' if 'x' is odd. You can use the Python modulus operator '%' to help select the even/odd entries. Important note: Do not print a newline character (i.e. `\\n`) when generating the string.

It simply puts `x2` on top of the stack so it can be fed to the add block of the half-residual layer. It then swaps the two outputs again so it can be fed to the next layer of the network.
